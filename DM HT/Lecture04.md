# 📚 Overview of the Knowledge Discovery Process (KDP)

---

## 🧩 What is KDP?

The **Knowledge Discovery Process (KDP)** is a step-by-step procedure used to find meaningful, novel, useful, and understandable patterns from large amounts of data.

It guides practitioners from **understanding the business problem** to using the discovered knowledge in **real-world decisions**.

---

## 🔎 Key Features of the KDP (Slide 7)

### 1️⃣ Sequential Steps
- The process flows **step by step**.
- Each step starts after the previous one finishes successfully.
- The **output of one step becomes the input** for the next.

**Example:**  
After **data cleaning**, the clean data becomes input for data mining algorithms.

---

### 2️⃣ Covers the Whole Journey

**Starts with:**
- Understanding the project domain (business/scientific problem).
- Understanding and preparing the data.

**Continues through:**
- Analyzing the data (applying data mining techniques).

**Ends with:**
- Evaluating the results.
- Applying the discovered knowledge to real-world problems.

---

### 3️⃣ Iterative Process
- Not strictly linear.
- **Feedback loops**: Revisit earlier steps if needed.

**Example:**  
If the model’s accuracy is low:
- Revisit **data preparation** (improve quality).
- Reconsider **problem definition** (clarify objectives).

## 🔗 Inputs and Outputs (Slide 7)

| Input                          | Output                                         |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Data**                      | **Knowledge**                                  |
| **Types:**                    | **Types:**                                     |
| - Databases                   | - Patterns                                    |
| - Images                      | - Rules                                       |
| - Video                       | - Clusters                                    |
| - Semi-structured data (XML, HTML) | - Classifications / Associations     |

**Example:**  
- **Input:** Customer purchase data  
- **Output:** "Customers aged 25–35 are likely to buy smartphones in December."

## 📝 How Practitioners Use KDP (Slide 8)

The KDP provides **procedures for practitioners** during a Knowledge Discovery project.

**Why?**
- **Organizes the work** → Clear steps avoid confusion.
- **Reduces project cost** → Prevents unnecessary repetition.
- **Improves project success** → Encourages systematic teamwork.

---

## 🕰 History and Evolution (Slide 9)

Since the 1990s, several KDP models have been developed.  
While they differ in step names and numbers, they share a **common structure**:

**Inputs:**  
- Data (numbers, text, images, video, etc.).

**Outputs:**  
- Knowledge (rules, patterns, classifications).

**Popular Models:**
- **Nine-Step Model** by Fayyad et al. (*academic focus*).
- **CRISP-DM Model** (*industry standard*).
- **Six-Step Model** by Cios et al. (*academic/industrial hybrid*).
