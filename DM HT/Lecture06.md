# üîµ CRISP-DM (CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)

---

## üìñ Purpose:
To provide a **standard framework** for carrying out data mining projects across industries.  
It is the **most widely used industrial standard** for data mining.

---

## üîé Who Developed CRISP-DM?

- **Integral Solutions Ltd.** (Data Mining solutions provider)
- **NCR** (Database provider)
- **Daimler Chrysler** (Automobile manufacturer)
- **OHRA** (Insurance company)

**Special Interest Group (SIG):**  
Over 300 users and service providers collaborated to support and refine the model.

## üî∑ CRISP-DM Six Main Steps

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Understanding (Slide 16)

**Goal:**  
- Understand business objectives.  
- Translate them into a data mining problem.

**Activities:**  
- Determine business objectives.  
- Assess the current situation (resources, data, constraints).  
- Define data mining goals.  
- Create a project plan.

**Example:**  
- *Business objective:* Reduce customer churn.  
- *Data mining goal:* Predict which customers are likely to cancel subscriptions.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding (Slide 16)

**Goal:**  
Collect data and identify data quality issues.

**Activities:**  
- Collect initial data.  
- Describe data (types, formats, ranges).  
- Explore data (visualizations, summary statistics).  
- Verify data quality.

**Example:**  
Collect customer demographics, past purchases, and service usage data.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation (Slide 17)

**Goal:**  
Prepare a final dataset for modeling.

**Activities:**  
- Select relevant fields/features.  
- Cleanse data (remove errors, handle missing values).  
- Construct new attributes/variables.  
- Integrate data from different sources.  
- Format data for modeling.

**Example:**  
- Create new feature "Tenure" (customer duration).  
- Remove outliers (e.g., negative usage values).

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Modeling (Slide 18)

**Goal:**  
Apply data mining models to the prepared data.

**Activities:**  
- Select modeling technique (decision trees, neural networks, etc.).  
- Generate test design.  
- Train the model.  
- Assess model performance.

**Note:**  
May require returning to Data Preparation if model needs adjustments.

**Example:**  
Use a random forest model to predict customer churn.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation (Slide 19)

**Goal:**  
Assess how well the model solves the business problem.

**Activities:**  
- Evaluate results.  
- Review the entire process.  
- Determine next steps (deploy or refine model).

**Example:**  
A high-accuracy model might still be unusable if too complex or misaligned with business needs.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment (Slide 20)

**Goal:**  
Implement the discovered knowledge or model in the business process.

**Activities:**  
- Plan deployment.  
- Plan monitoring and maintenance.  
- Generate final report.  
- Review the process for future improvements.

**Deployment Forms:**  
- **Simple:** Generate a report.  
- **Complex:** Build an automated system (e.g., CRM integration).

**Example:**  
Deploy the churn prediction model in the CRM system for proactive customer retention.

---

## üîÑ Iterative Nature (Slide 21)

CRISP-DM is **not strictly linear**.

**Loops between steps:**  
- Poor modeling results ‚Üí Return to Data Preparation or Data Understanding.  
- Changing business objectives ‚Üí Revise Business Understanding.

**Why?**  
Data mining projects are dynamic. New insights often require revisiting earlier assumptions.

## ‚úÖ Key Strengths of CRISP-DM (Slide 21)

| Strength           | Explanation                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Easy to understand | Uses simple, well-defined vocabulary.             |
| Good documentation | Widely supported by guides and case studies.      |
| Iterative process  | Allows flexibility and revisiting earlier steps.  |
| Real-world proven  | Extensively used in industry (medicine, marketing, etc.). |

**Commercial Example:**  
CRISP-DM became the foundation for the **Clementine¬Æ** data mining system (by SPSS).
