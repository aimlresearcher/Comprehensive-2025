## 🔎 Key Idea: Why Understand the Process Before Mining Data?

Before applying data mining (DM) techniques, it’s essential to understand the **Knowledge Discovery Process (KDP)**.

**Why?**
- Jumping straight to algorithms → Poor, irrelevant, or misleading results.
- A **step-by-step process** ensures:
  - Structured progress.
  - Repeatability.
  - Quality control.

## 🧭 What is the Knowledge Discovery Process (KDP)?

**KDP =** A sequence of steps (with feedback loops) to:
- Discover **valid, novel, useful, and understandable** patterns.
- Guide data scientists from **raw data to actionable knowledge**.

**Covers not just mining, but also:**
- How data is stored and accessed.
- Choosing efficient/scalable algorithms.
- Visualizing and interpreting results.
- Combining human expertise with ML outputs.

## 🧐 Why Do We Need a Standardized KDP Model? (Slide 5)

### 1️⃣ Logical Structure
- Explains why each step is necessary.
  
### 2️⃣ Ensures Usefulness
- Helps ensure the results are **practical** for the data owner.

### 3️⃣ Project Management
- KD projects involve multiple tasks, teams, and tools.
- A model provides a **roadmap** for better management.

### 4️⃣ Following Other Disciplines
- Like **Agile/Waterfall** in software engineering, DM needs structured approaches.

### 5️⃣ Stimulates Industry Growth
- Easier to train people, compare tools, and improve practices across the DM industry.

## 🔬 Definition of KDP (Slide 6)

**KDP** = A **non-trivial process** of identifying **valid, novel, useful, and understandable** patterns in data.

### 🔍 Breaking it down:
| Term            | Meaning                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Non-trivial     | Complex and requires careful thought.         |
| Valid           | Must reflect real-world truths.               |
| Novel           | Should reveal new insights.                   |
| Useful          | Must be actionable and practical.             |
| Understandable  | Should be clear and interpretable by humans.  |

## 🔗 What Does KDP Include?

| KDP Aspect              | Description                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Storage & Access   | How/where data is stored. Must be accessible/manageable.       |
| Algorithms              | Choosing efficient/scalable methods for pattern discovery.     |
| Interpretation & Visualization | Tools/methods for understanding and presenting results.|
| Human-Machine Interaction | Ensures humans can guide and validate ML outputs.            |
| Domain Learning         | Understanding the specific problem context (e.g., healthcare).|

## 🔄 KDP is Iterative

- **Steps are sequential**, but feedback loops are common.
- Poor results → Go back and revise earlier steps.

📝 **Example:**  
If a model performs poorly, revisit **data preprocessing** or **problem definition**.

## 📝 Summary of Introduction

| Key Point                | Explanation                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| KDP is essential         | Guides the entire DM process systematically.              |
| Standardization is important | Improves success rates and project management.      |
| KDP includes multiple tasks | Data storage, algorithm choice, visualization, etc. |
| Iterative process        | Mistakes/poor results lead to revisions of earlier steps. |

## 📊 Real-World Example

**Scenario:**  
A **bank** wants to predict loan defaults.

| Without KDP                         | With KDP                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Jump straight into running an algorithm → Confusing, possibly useless model | **Step 1:** Understand the problem. <br> **Step 2:** Prepare data (income, debt, payment history). <br> **Step 3:** Clean data. <br> **Step 4:** Choose DM methods (e.g., decision trees). <br> **Step 5:** Interpret results (important variables). <br> **Step 6:** Deploy model in the loan approval process. |

**Result:**  
The project is **organized, efficient, and effective**.
