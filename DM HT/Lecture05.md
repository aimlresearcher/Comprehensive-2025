# 🔵 Nine-Step Model by Fayyad et al.

---

## 📖 Purpose:
To describe a structured, iterative process for discovering **valid, novel, useful, and understandable** patterns from data.

---

## 📅 Introduced:
Mid-1990s, foundational in academic and industrial data mining.

---

## 🔷 Step 1: Developing and Understanding the Application Domain

**Goal:**  
- Understand the problem domain.  
- Learn relevant background knowledge.  
- Identify goals specified by the end-user.

**What happens:**  
- Meet with domain experts.  
- Understand constraints, expectations, and objectives.

**Example:**  
*Healthcare:* Predict which patients are at risk of diabetes.

---

## 🔷 Step 2: Creating a Target Data Set

**Goal:**  
Select specific attributes and data points relevant to the task.

**What happens:**  
- Query existing data.  
- Filter out unrelated data.  
- Focus on the needed data subset.

**Example:**  
Loan default prediction → Select features like age, income, loan amount, repayment history.

---

## 🔷 Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

**Goal:**  
Remove errors, handle missing values, and deal with noisy data.

**What happens:**  
- Outlier detection/removal.  
- Handle missing values.  
- Address time-sequence issues (if temporal data).

**Example:**  
Healthcare data with missing lab results → Impute missing values.

**Why important:**  
Quality data = Better models.

---

## 🔷 Step 4: Data Reduction and Projection

**Goal:**  
Simplify data while preserving important information.

**What happens:**  
- Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).  
- Feature selection.  
- Feature engineering.

**Example:**  
Reduce 50 medical measurements to the 5 most significant ones.

**Why important:**  
- Reduces computation time.  
- Improves performance.  
- Avoids the curse of dimensionality.

---

## 🔷 Step 5: Choosing the Data Mining Task

**Goal:**  
Define the kind of knowledge to extract.

**What happens:**  
Match project goals to a DM task:
- **Classification** → Predict categories.  
- **Regression** → Predict numeric values.  
- **Clustering** → Group similar records.  
- **Association Rule Mining** → Discover relationships.

**Example:**  
Customer segmentation → Choose clustering.

---

## 🔷 Step 6: Choosing the Data Mining Algorithm

**Goal:**  
Select the algorithm to perform the task.

**What happens:**  
- Choose models (e.g., Decision Trees, Neural Networks, K-means).  
- Set algorithm parameters.

**Example:**  
Classification → Try Decision Trees or SVM.

**Note:**  
Test multiple algorithms if needed.

---

## 🔷 Step 7: Data Mining

**Goal:**  
Apply the chosen algorithm(s) to generate patterns/models.

**What happens:**  
Run the algorithm and produce:
- Rules.  
- Decision trees.  
- Clusters.  
- Trends.

**Example:**  
Loan default prediction → Build a decision tree.

---

## 🔷 Step 8: Interpreting Mined Patterns

**Goal:**  
Understand and validate the discovered patterns.

**What happens:**  
- Visualize results.  
- Discuss with domain experts.  
- Check if patterns make sense, are valid, novel, and useful.

**Example:**  
Verify if younger loan applicants with high debt default more frequently.

---

## 🔷 Step 9: Consolidating Discovered Knowledge

**Goal:**  
Deploy the knowledge into real-world decision-making.

**What happens:**  
- Deploy model (e.g., in loan approval systems).  
- Document findings.  
- Resolve conflicts with existing knowledge.

**Example:**  
Use the loan default model in the bank’s application process.

## 🔄 Iterative Nature of the Process (Slide 14)

- **Not strictly linear**.
- Feedback loops between steps.
- Poor results → Revisit earlier steps (e.g., Step 4 for better features).
