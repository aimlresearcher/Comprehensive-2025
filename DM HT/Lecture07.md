# üîµ Six-Step Model by Cios et al.

---

## üîé Overview

- Developed as a hybrid between academic (like Fayyad‚Äôs model) and industrial (like CRISP-DM) approaches.
- Designed for both academic research and practical applications.
- Introduces **six clear steps**.
- Emphasizes **explicit feedback loops** for iteration and correction.
- Adaptable for projects where knowledge might be reused across domains.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Understanding the Problem Domain (Slide 24)

**Objective:**  
- Define the problem clearly with domain experts.  
- Translate business/scientific goals into data mining goals.

**Activities:**  
- Identify key people and stakeholders.  
- Learn domain-specific terminology.  
- Analyze existing solutions.  
- Determine project goals and restrictions.  
- Select initial data mining tools.

**Example:**  
Healthcare ‚Üí Goal: *Predict the risk of diabetes in patients based on historical health data.*

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Understanding the Data (Slide 24)

**Objective:**  
Collect relevant data and assess its quality and structure.

**Activities:**  
- Decide required data (format, size).  
- Check data completeness, redundancy, missing values, plausibility.  
- Ensure data aligns with mining goals.

**Example:**  
Patient records ‚Üí Age, weight, blood sugar, medical history.  
Check for missing/unusual values (e.g., negative ages).

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Preparation of the Data (Slide 25)

**Objective:**  
Prepare a clean and structured dataset for data mining algorithms.

**Activities:**  
- Data sampling and correlation analysis.  
- Clean data ‚Üí Handle missing values, correct noise.  
- Feature selection/extraction ‚Üí Reduce dimensionality.  
- Create new attributes (e.g., BMI from weight and height).  
- Summarize or discretize variables.

**Example:**  
If 20% of blood pressure readings are missing ‚Üí Impute values or remove records.

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Data Mining (Slide 25)

**Objective:**  
Apply data mining algorithms to discover patterns, relationships, or predictions.

**Activities:**  
- Choose suitable data mining methods (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).  
- Train and test models.

**Example:**  
Apply a decision tree to predict patient diabetes risk.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Evaluation of the Discovered Knowledge (Slide 26)

**Objective:**  
Verify the usefulness, novelty, and validity of the discovered knowledge.

**Activities:**  
- Interpret results with domain experts.  
- Check novelty and business/scientific impact.  
- Validate results statistically or with new datasets.  
- Retain approved models.  
- Document errors and consider improvements.

**Example:**  
High BMI and family history are top diabetes predictors ‚Üí Confirm with medical experts.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Use of the Discovered Knowledge (Slide 26)

**Objective:**  
Deploy the discovered knowledge into real-world use or further research.

**Activities:**  
- Plan knowledge application.  
- Extend knowledge to other domains if applicable.  
- Monitor model performance.  
- Document project and deployment process.

**Example:**  
Integrate the diabetes risk model into the hospital‚Äôs patient management system.

## üîÑ Explicit Feedback Loops (Slides 27 & 28)

**Key Feature:**  
Multiple feedback loops promote flexibility and iterative improvements.

| From                     | To                         | Reason                                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Understanding the Data   | Understanding the Problem  | New data issues may require revising the problem.    |
| Preparation of the Data  | Understanding the Data     | Data issues may require additional or different data.|
| Data Mining              | Understanding the Problem  | Poor results may need goal redefinition.             |
| Data Mining              | Understanding the Data     | Misunderstood data might lead to poor results.       |
| Data Mining              | Preparation of the Data    | Model demands might change data preparation needs.   |
| Evaluation               | Understanding the Problem  | Poor/invalid knowledge ‚Üí Revisit initial assumptions.|
| Evaluation               | Data Mining                | Patterns may require testing alternative algorithms. |

**Why important?**  
Real-world projects rarely follow a perfect straight line.  
This model handles unexpected challenges effectively.
