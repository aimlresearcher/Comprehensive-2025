## ðŸ”Ž What is Dynamic Data?


**Dynamic data** refers to:
- Data that **changes over time**.
- New data points are frequently **added**.
- Existing data may be **updated or removed**.

## ðŸ”Ž Examples of Dynamic Data

| Domain         | Example                                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Stock Market   | Stock prices update every second.              |
| Social Media   | Tweets, likes, comments constantly added.      |
| IoT Devices    | Sensor readings update in real-time (temperature, humidity). |
| Online Retail  | Customer orders and inventory levels change continuously. |
| Healthcare     | Patient monitoring data (heart rate, glucose levels). |

## ðŸ”Ž Why is Dynamic Data Important?

| Reason                   | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reflects reality         | Most real-world systems generate dynamic data.                 |
| Up-to-date analysis      | Critical for fraud detection, stock prediction, traffic management. |
| Challenges traditional DM | Many data mining algorithms assume static data â†’ Need special techniques. |

## ðŸ”Ž Data Mining and Dynamic Data

| Challenge               | Solution                                                        |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data changes rapidly    | Use **incremental learning algorithms** to update models without retraining. |
| High volume             | Apply **stream mining methods** for continuous data.             |
| Real-time decision making | Use **online learning** and real-time analytics.               |

## âœ… Key Takeaway

Dynamic data requires **special techniques and algorithms** because:
- It is **constantly changing**.
- **Fast, efficient, and adaptive data mining methods** are essential for real-world dynamic data applications.
