---

## 📖 Slide 11  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Data Sets**  
- Objects with the same features are grouped into data sets.  
- Most data mining tools expect data sets in flat file format:
  - Rows = objects (e.g., patients).
  - Columns = features (e.g., age, blood pressure).  
- Flat files often come from spreadsheets or databases.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Data sets are collections where each object shares the same features.  
They are commonly stored in 2D flat files for easy processing.

---

## 📖 Slide 12  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Data Sets Example**  
- Example: Patient data at a heart clinic.  
- Issues:
  - Missing values (NULL).
  - Incorrect values (e.g., extreme cholesterol levels).
  - Multiple records for the same patient.  
- Stored as flat files with features like name, age, sex, and test results.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Real-world data often contains missing or incorrect values and duplicate records.  
These issues need to be addressed during data preparation.

---

- Specialized databases (transactional, spatial, temporal, text, multimedia).
- World Wide Web (WWW).

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Besides flat files, data can come from various advanced storage systems designed to handle specific data types and large data volumes.

---

## 📖 Slide 15  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Why Use Database Systems?**  
- Flat files may be too big for memory.  
- Data mining needs quick access to data subsets.  
- Data is updated often by multiple users.  
- Databases reduce redundancy using multiple tables.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Databases offer efficient storage, easy updates, and faster data retrieval, making them better than flat files for large and dynamic data.

---

## 📖 Slide 16  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Database Management System (DBMS)**  
A DBMS includes:
- Data storage.
- Programs to manage and access data quickly.  
Services:

- Provide security to prevent unauthorized access and crashes.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
A DBMS is essential for organizing, accessing, and protecting data efficiently, especially in large, multi-user environments.

---

## 📖 Slide 17  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Databases**  
Relational databases:
- Use tables (similar to flat files).
- Columns = attributes.
- Rows = records.  
- Each table has a primary key (unique ID).  
- The ER (Entity-Relationship) model defines tables and their relationships.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Relational databases structure data into tables with clearly defined relationships, simplifying data management and retrieval.

---

## 📖 Slide 18  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Databases**  
- Multiple tables help avoid data duplication.  
- Data is divided into small, manageable parts.  
**Example:**  
Patient data split into:
- Patients table.
- Blood pressure tests table.
- Cholesterol tests table.  
All linked by a primary key.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Splitting data into multiple related tables prevents redundancy and makes data easier to manage and analyze.

---

## 📖 Slide 19  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Databases**  
- DBMS uses SQL (Structured Query Language).  
- SQL allows fast access to specific data.  
**Example:**  
Retrieve tests performed during a specific time period.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
SQL is the language used to manage and query databases, allowing users to easily retrieve relevant data for analysis.

---

## 📖 Slide 20

- Data is cleaned, transformed, and integrated.  
- Loaded into the data warehouse for easy access and analysis.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Data warehouses combine and clean data from multiple sources, making it easier to analyze all the information in one place.

---

## 📖 Slide 24  
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)  
**Data Warehouses**  
- Use multidimensional databases.

- CLIP4 → Quadratic, O(n²).  
- C4.5 → Cubic, O(n³).

### 🔎 Brief Explanation  
Different algorithms handle data growth differently. Log-linear is most efficient, while cubic grows much slower and becomes impractical with large data.

---

## 📖 Slide 41
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**High Dimensionality**
- Example of how complexity affects performance:
  - 100 objects:
    - Linear algorithm → 1,000 seconds.
    - Cubic algorithm → 100,000 seconds.
  - 1,000 objects:
    - Linear algorithm → 10,000 seconds.
    - Cubic algorithm → 100 million seconds.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Algorithms with higher complexity (like cubic) slow down significantly as data size increases.

---

## 📖 Slide 42
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**High Dimensionality**
To improve scalability:
- **Speed up the algorithm**:
  - **Heuristics**: Limit rule length.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Partitioning and reducing dimensionality make large datasets easier to manage.

---

## 📖 Slide 44
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**Dynamic Data**
- Data changes over time.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Incomplete data needs to be recognized and supplemented with additional data.

---

## 📖 Slide 47
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**Incomplete Data**
- Analyze if existing data fully represents the problem.
- If not, collect more data (new features or more objects).

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Assess existing data for gaps and gather missing information as needed.

---

## 📖 Slide 48
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**Redundant Data**
- Occurs when objects are duplicated or features are strongly correlated.
- Sometimes removed, but may be useful (e.g., frequency insights).
- Irrelevant data should be ignored.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Redundant data is often removed but can sometimes provide valuable insights. Irrelevant data should be excluded from analysis.

---

## 📖 Slide 49
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**Redundant Data**

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Single imputation fills missing values with reasonable estimates like the mean or mode.

---

## 📖 Slide 53
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**Missing Values**
- **Hot deck imputation**: For each object with missing values, find the most similar object and use its values. Repeat until all missing values are filled.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Hot deck imputation fills missing values by borrowing data from the most similar object.

---

## 📖 Slide 54
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
Noise can be managed by removing or adjusting values using various techniques.

---

## 📖 Slide 56
### 📝 Rewritten Content (Simple Language)
**Noise**
- **Clustering for noise removal**: Group similar data into clusters. Values that don’t fit any cluster are considered noise and removed or marked as missing.

### 🔎 Brief Explanation
