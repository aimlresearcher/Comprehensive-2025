# ðŸ“˜ Principles of Operating Systems

Operating systems are built upon foundational principles that guide how they manage hardware and software resources efficiently, securely, and reliably.

## ðŸ”· 1. Separation of Policy and Mechanism
- **Mechanism:** How something is done (e.g., how to schedule processes).
- **Policy:** What should be done (e.g., which process to run next).
- **Why important?** Enhances flexibility by allowing the policy to change without rewriting mechanisms.

## ðŸ”· 2. Process Abstraction
- A process is a program in execution.
- OS provides isolation, scheduling, and inter-process communication (IPC).
- Ensures that each process runs independently, securely, and gets fair CPU time.

## ðŸ”· 3. Resource Management
- OS allocates resources (CPU, memory, disk, I/O) among users and programs.
- Ensures:
  - **Fairness:** No resource monopolization.
  - **Efficiency:** Maximum throughput.
  - **Protection:** No unauthorized access.

## ðŸ”· 4. Concurrency
- Support for multiple processes or threads executing simultaneously.
- Requires synchronization (e.g., semaphores) to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.
- Crucial for multitasking and multi-core processors.

## ðŸ”· 5. Virtualization
- OS provides an abstract view of hardware to each process (e.g., virtual memory, virtual CPU).
- Enables:
  - **Security:** Sandboxing.
  - **Portability:** Run same software on different hardware.
  - **Flexibility:** Simultaneous execution of isolated environments.

## ðŸ”· 6. Security and Protection
- Distinction between authorized and unauthorized access.
- OS enforces:
  - Access control lists (ACLs).
  - User authentication.
  - Privilege levels (user mode vs kernel mode).

## ðŸ”· 7. File System Organization
- Files are organized into hierarchical directories.
- OS ensures:
  - Naming conventions.
  - Permissions.
  - Efficient storage & retrieval.

## ðŸ”· 8. Portability
- OS design should allow it to be easily adapted to different hardware platforms.
- Achieved via abstraction and modular architecture.

## ðŸ”· 9. Modularity and Layering
- OS is built in layers or modules, each responsible for a specific function (e.g., I/O, memory, files).
- Allows easier maintenance, upgrades, and troubleshooting.

## ðŸ”· 10. Fault Tolerance and Recovery
- OS should detect and recover from errors gracefully (e.g., corrupted file, crashed process).
- Prevents system-wide failures and ensures reliability.
