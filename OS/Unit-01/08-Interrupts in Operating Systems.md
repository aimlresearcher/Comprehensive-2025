# ⚡ Interrupts in Operating Systems

## 🔍 What is an Interrupt?
An **interrupt** is a signal sent to the CPU by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention.

### 🧠 Purpose:
Interrupts pause the current process, save its state, and switch the CPU to run an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** to handle the event.

## 🧩 Why Are Interrupts Needed?

### Without interrupts:
- The CPU must **poll** (continuously check) devices for events → inefficient.

### With interrupts:
- Devices notify the CPU **only when needed** → efficient multitasking and better performance.

## 🔧 Types of Interrupts

| Type                | Description                                            | Example                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware Interrupt** | Generated by external devices via interrupt controller | Keyboard key press, mouse click              |
| **Software Interrupt** | Triggered by executing a system call                   | `int 0x80` in x86 Linux for system calls     |
| **Timer Interrupt**    | Issued by a hardware timer to enable preemptive multitasking | Used by OS to switch processes        |
| **I/O Interrupt**      | From I/O devices to signal completion of an operation  | Disk read complete                           |
| **Internal (Trap/Fault)** | Caused by an error or exception within the CPU         | Divide by zero, invalid memory access        |

## 🧠 Interrupt Handling Process

1. **Interrupt Signal Received**
2. **CPU finishes current instruction**
3. **CPU switches to kernel mode**
4. **Program Counter (PC)** and **CPU state** are saved
5. **CPU jumps to the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**
6. **ISR handles the event**
7. **CPU state is restored** and the previous process resumes

> ✅ **OS ensures** that interrupts are prioritized and can even be **nested** (high-priority interrupts can interrupt lower-priority ones).
