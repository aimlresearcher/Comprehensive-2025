## 🔁 Key Milestones in OS Evolution

### 🟩 1. No Operating Systems (1940s – 50s)
- Early computers lacked software.
- Programs loaded manually.
- No user interface or file system.

### 🟩 2. Batch Processing Systems (1950s – 60s)
- Jobs grouped and processed in batches.
- No direct user interaction.
- Input via punch cards.
- **Limitations:** No multitasking, slow turnaround time.

### 🟩 3. Multiprogramming and Time-Sharing (1960s – 70s)
- Multiple jobs in memory simultaneously.
- Time-sharing gave each user a time slice of CPU.
- UNIX developed at Bell Labs: portable, multitasking.
- Improved CPU utilization.

### 🟩 4. Personal Computer Era (1980s – 2000s)
- Emergence of user-friendly GUI-based OS.
- Desktop OS like Windows, Macintosh OS.
- Support for multitasking and plug-and-play hardware.

### 🟩 5. Networked and Distributed Systems
- Systems connected via LAN/WAN.
- Client-server and peer-to-peer models.
- File and resource sharing became common.

### 🟩 6. Mobile and Cloud OS (2000s – Present)
- OS tailored for smartphones and tablets (Android, iOS).
- Virtualization (VMware, Hyper-V).
- Cloud OS manage distributed data centers (e.g., Google Fuchsia, Azure OS).

## 📌 Trends in OS Evolution
- **Security focus:** From basic protection to advanced encryption & firewalls.
- **Scalability:** Handling from IoT devices to multi-node data centers.
- **Real-time systems:** OS with guaranteed response times (used in robotics, aviation).
- **AI integration:** Predictive scheduling, self-healing systems.
