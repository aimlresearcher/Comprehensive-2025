# 🖧 Device Organization & System Operations

This topic focuses on how devices are structured and managed by the operating system, and how basic system operations (like interrupts and execution modes) enable the OS to handle tasks efficiently and securely.

## 🔧 Device Organization

Devices in a computer system (e.g., keyboard, hard disk, printer) are typically categorized and managed based on their interaction patterns with the CPU and OS.

### 🔹 Types of Devices

| Device Type        | Examples                 | Characteristics               |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Input Devices      | Keyboard, Mouse          | Send data to system           |
| Output Devices     | Monitor, Printer         | Receive data from system      |
| Storage Devices    | HDD, SSD, USB            | Persistent storage            |
| Communication      | Network cards, Modems    | Enable system-to-system interaction |

### 🔹 Device Controller
- Hardware interface that connects the device to the system bus.
- Each controller has **registers** and a **buffer**.
- OS interacts with the device via its controller using I/O operations.

### 🔹 Device Drivers
- Software modules that translate OS-level commands into device-specific operations.
- Each device type (keyboard, disk, etc.) has its own driver.

## ⚙️ System Operations

### 🔹 1. Interrupts
Interrupts allow the CPU to be notified when a device needs attention (e.g., input is ready, output is done).

| Type              | Triggered By                   | Purpose                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Hardware Interrupt| I/O devices (e.g., keyboard)    | Notify CPU of completed task      |
| Software Interrupt| Program (via system calls)      | Request OS services               |
| Timer Interrupt   | System clock                    | Preempt running processes for multitasking |

> **Key Concept:** Instead of polling for every device, the CPU executes tasks until interrupted, saving CPU time.

### 🔹 2. Dual Mode Operation

To protect the OS from malicious or faulty user programs, modern processors support two execution modes:

| Mode        | Who uses it?     | Permissions                         |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| User Mode   | Applications     | Limited: cannot access hardware directly |
| Kernel Mode | Operating System | Full access to hardware and memory  |

- Switching between these modes happens during **system calls** or **interrupt handling**.

---

### 🔹 3. System Calls

System calls are the programming interface between user applications and the OS kernel.

**Examples of System Calls:**
- `read()` / `write()` – File I/O
- `fork()` / `exec()` – Process creation
- `open()` / `close()` – File handling
- `wait()` – Process synchronization

---

### 🔹 4. Direct Memory Access (DMA)

- Allows devices to transfer data to/from memory without CPU intervention.
- CPU sets up DMA, then continues other work.
- Improves efficiency during large I/O operations (e.g., copying a large file).

---

### 🔹 5. Buffering and Caching

- **Buffering:** Temporary storage in memory for I/O (e.g., print spooler).
- **Caching:** Frequently accessed data kept in faster memory for quicker access (e.g., disk cache).
